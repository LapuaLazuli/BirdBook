## Problem statement

Although birdwatching is an extremely rewarding experience, it does have a knowledge barrier that can make serious birdwatching a daunting task. Rather than lugging around cumbersome (and sometimes pricey) books of knowledge, BirdBook offers a way to get into birding that's quick, easy, and free. 

## Solution

With BirdBook, a list of birds in your area are shown, with an overview. For more information, a bird's info page can be viewed for a more detailed look at the bird's behavior, diet, and other helpful bits of information. With information like what the bird's call sounds like, where they are usually found, and their appearance, it is easier than ever before to find birds to watch!

## Technical Approach

In order to deliver the best product, we employed agile development with a focus on our most important users. Over a few short months, we managed to deliver a product that birdwatchers can use to improve their experience.
